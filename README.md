This repository contains a collection of basic apps and games I created for learning and practicing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The projects include:

1.Calculator: A simple calculator to perform basic arithmetic operations.
2.Tic-Tac-Toe: A classic two-player game implemented with interactive UI.
3.Rock-Paper-Scissors: A fun game where you can play against the computer.
4.Weather App: A weather forecasting app that fetches real-time data.
5.Currency Converter: An app that converts currencies based on the latest exchange rates.
These projects helped me strengthen my foundational skills in web development. Feel free to explore, use, and improve upon them! I'll update them and I'll add more app later in this.
